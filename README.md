This repository contains the paper list of **Graph Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Generalization**. The existing literature can be summarized into three categories from conceptually different perspectives, i.e., *data*, *model*, and *learning strategy*, based on their positions in the graph machine learning pipeline. 
For more details, please refer to our survey paper: [Out-Of-Distribution Generalization on Graphs: A Survey.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.07987.pdf) 

We will try our best to make this paper list updated. If you notice some related papers missing, do not hesitate to contact us via pull requests at our repo.
